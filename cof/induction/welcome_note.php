Probably, this has set you wondering if you possess the requisite qualities to succeed in the hotel industry. Well, here is a checklist of personal qualities to help you assess for yourself how well you are suited to working in a hotel. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p ><b>1. SELF CONTROL:</b> </p>
                    
                    <p >In a hotel, the first thing you must learn is that the Customer is always right. Hence you'll be expected to be polite, calm, pleasant and friendly. Arguments, discussions, excuses and explanations are to be avoided at any cost because they only add fuel to the fire instead of helping you to resolve the problem. </p>
                    
                    <p ><b>2. FRIENDLY AND OUTGOING PERSONALITY: </b></p>
                    <p >If you are naturally friendly and outgoing you are more likely to be successful working in a hotel. Being able to deal with all kinds of guests and visitors combined with a keenness to serve them with a genuine smile is an asset. </p>
                    
                    <p ><b>3. RIGHT ATTITUDE TO WORK:</b> </p>
                    <p >While working in the hotel, you may be called upon to do the most menial jobs, like washing utensils, cleaning toilets, chopping vegetables, etc. You should be prepared to do any kind of job if the circumstances demand it. Dignity of labour is one of the first lessons you’ll have to learn. It is possible; you'll discover along how much more satisfying it is to work with one's own hands. </p>
                    
                    <p ><b>4. GOOD HEALTH AND PHYSICAL FITNESS:</b> </p>
                    <p >You need good mental and physical stamina to survive the long and odd working hours. Moreover, you may have to spend most of your working day on your feet, especially on busy days. Unless you are physically in good health, you won't be able to take the strain. </p>
                    
                    <p ><b>5. WELL GROOMED, PLEASING PERSONALITY:</b> </p>
                    <p >It will give you confidence. if you are well groomed, neat, polite and have an easy way with people. An impressive and pleasing appearance is always a plus point in public relations. </p>
                    
                    <p ><b>6. ABILITY TO FACE CHALLENGES:</b> </p>
                    <p >There is never a dull moment in a hotel. You'll find that each working day throws up new challenges, stimulates you mentally and physically so much that on the rare day when business is dull, you may feel lethargic and bored because you have got accustomed to working at a high-tension level. </p>
                    
                    <p ><b>7. TEAM SPIRIT:</b> </p>
                    <p >In a service industry like a hotel where you work as part of a team, it is very important to be co-operative, helpful and willing to listen to others. You must be flexible and accommodating and enjoy working as part of a team. So, if you are a loner, then this is not exactly your scene. </p>
                   
                   
                    <p ><b>8. SELF DISCIPLINE:</b> </p>
                    <p >Just about every item in a hotel can be useful; there can be lot of temptation to carry out small things for personal use. You must be able to resist such temptation, and be honest and sincere in your job. </p>
                   
                   
                    <p ><b>9. ABILITY FOR HARD WORK:</b> </p>
                    <p >A job in a hotel is demanding. Only those who do not avoid hard work and are sincere can hope to rise in their career. An employee, who works willingly is always noticed by the management and is likely to go places. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p ><b>10. HIGH MOTIVATION:</b> </p>
                    <p >Self motivation is very necessary if you want to reach anywhere in life. In fact, it is this quality which will help you to enjoy even the most menial job. Most people who succeed in life are highly motivated. They work with great enthusiasm, take initiative and do not mind learning even from their subordinate </p>
                    
                    
                    <p ><b>11. SELF CONFIDENCE:</b> </p>
                    <p >While working in a hotel, you'll come across well-placed people who are successful, rich, and powerful and hold high positions in life. You will discover that if you remain poised, composed and at ease in the company of such people you'll do your job better. Being self-confident will enable you to deal with people of all kinds. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p ><b>12. TACT:</b> </p>
                    <p >This is an indispensable quality needed to handle a tricky or nasty situation, whether it is guests acting difficult in the restaurant, or disciplining a member of the staff. Despite all pressures you must remain cool, even-tempered and handle each situation tactfully and coolly. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p ><b>13. GOOD COMMUNICATION SKILLS:</b> </p>
                    <p >A hotel job involves working with people all the time. Therefore, it will be a great asset for you as well as the hotel, if you are an impressive talker and can interact with people smoothly and gracefully. Good command over one or more languages, both Indian and foreign, will definitely put you in a position of advantage over others who may not be so proficient and/or fluent. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p ><b>14. METICULOUSNESS:</b> </p>
                    <p >You must have an eye for detail and ensure that everything is well organised and in order up to the last detail. The job will demand that you be aware, observant, alert and alive to all that happens around you. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p ><b>15. RESOURCEFULNESS AND INNOVATIVENESS:</b> </p>
                    <p >You will need these two valuable qualities to cope and deal effectively with new situations and difficulties that may arise. You must be able to think and react quickly without breaking down under pressure or running to your seniors for help and guidance all the time. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p ><b>16. FLAIR FOR CREATIVE WORK:</b> </p>
                    <p >Working in a hotel requires a creative and imaginative mind. There will be occasions when you will need to use your artistic sense, for example, for table layout, flower arrangements, room decor, etc. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p ><b>17. REASONABLY WELL INFORMED:</b> </p>
                    <p >It will be of immense help if you keep yourself up-to-date on what is happening in the world-current affairs, political situations and recent developments, etc. After all, hotels get all types of guests from all over the world. You will find that your knowledge of different cultures and events will help you in making a personal contact and the right impression with the guests. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p ><b>18. PERCEPTIVENESS: </b></p>
                    <p >To anticipate a guest's needs without his spelling it out requires sensitivity, perception, understanding of human nature, compassion and appreciation of the fact that people are different. At times, people, appear difficult because we don't understand them. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p ><b>19. DOWN TO EARTH APPROACH:</b> </p>
                    <p >You must be practical. Remember your attitude and approach to work will affect those directly under you. If you will not consider it below your dignity to work with your own hands, then your team will follow suit. </p>
                    <p >I hope that the above would help you in understanding the operational requirements of this industry, a little better. </p>
